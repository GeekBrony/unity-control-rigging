# com.geekbrony.control-rigging
This package contains extra functionality to create and maintain complex rigs in Unity, using Unity's Animation Rigging package.

Included in this package:
- Armature assets with mappable bones, which can be shared across many character prefabs.
- Rig assets, which can simplify the creation/reproduction of complex procedural rigs.
- More constraints that can be used by the Animation Rigging package.
